# What's a "decision tree?".
#
# A tree is a model used in computer science.
# It starts at the root (top of tree), then takes step down based on
# questions/feature comparisons.
# Example (fruit classifier):
#
#              start
#                |
#          |-----+-----------|
#       [heavy?]         [not heavy?]
#          |                 |
#         melon              |
#                      [ red or orange? ]
#                            |
#                  [ red? ]--+---[ orange? ]
#                      |             |
#                    apple         orange
